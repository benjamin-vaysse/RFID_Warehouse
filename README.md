# RFID_Warehouse

A simple project aiming at simulating a RFID enabled warehouse. A RFID reader connected to an Arduino card scans tags and sends information about the scanned products to a Raspberry Pi. The list of scanned products is rendered using a dynamic PHP webpage.

Arduino : C language
Raspberry Pi : Python with serial module (to communicate with the Arduino)
